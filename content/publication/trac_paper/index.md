abstract: Many tasks in image-guided surgery require a clinician to manually position an instrument in space, with respect to a patient, with five or six degrees of freedom (DOF). Displaying the current and desired pose of the object on a 2D display such as a computer monitor is straightforward. However, providing guidance to accurately and rapidly navigate the object in 5-DOF or 6-DOF is challenging. Guidance is typically accomplished by showing distinct orthogonal viewpoints of the workspace, requiring simultaneous alignment in all views. Although such methods are commonly used, they can be quite unintuitive, and it can take a long time to perform an accurate 5-DOF or 6-DOF alignment task. In this article, we describe a method of visually communicating navigation instructions using translational and rotational arrow cues (TRAC) defined in an objectcentric frame, while displaying a single principal view that approximates the human’s egocentric view of the physical object. The target pose of the object is provided but typically is used only for the initial gross alignment. During the accuratealignment stage, the user follows the unambiguous arrow commands. In a series of human-subject studies, we show that the TRAC method outperforms two common orthogonal-view methods—the triplanar display, and a sight-alignment method that closely approximates the Acrobot Navigation System—in terms of time to complete 5-DOF and 6-DOF navigation tasks. We also find that subjects can achieve 1 mm and 1 degree accuracy using the TRAC method with a median completion time of less than 20 seconds.
