This ongoing project examines the use of a minimal-designed microsurgery manipulator for various surgical tasks. It involved full design of a robot and handheld mechatronic system for control, material science research for optimal manipulator performance, and exploration of applications in the Orthopedic, ENT, and Opthalmalogic spaces.
