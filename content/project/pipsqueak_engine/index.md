A small air engine was designed in a university-instructed CAD class, between David and another student. The engine was designed in Autodesk Inventor.

A similar air engine was then manufactured by David and another student from raw materials (lathe, mill, band saw, etc) using traditional machining methods. The team won the best presentation award.
