Cord organization in the bedside hospital setting can be a particular nuisance and take a lot of time and energy from visiting nurses. This project built a startup company (NurseTech) and full business plan around a new design for a plastic-injection molded clip which easily and simply organizes medical tubes and cords which are generally attached to the patient.

The NurseTech team participated in the NSF/JHU 2022 Winter Market Research I-CORPS program, and won 2nd place in the Johns Hopkins FFU Medical Device Pitch competition. They raised over $15k in funding for development of their product. They also secured a provisional patent for their technology.
