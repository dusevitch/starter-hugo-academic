In just 8 months a completely novel concept for an automated food bar machine was designed, prototyped multiple times, and built to achieve full automation of custom food bar creation in under 1 minute. David operated as the Mechatronics lead on a very small team, designing the electrical components and controls, as well as building the first physical prototype.

A patent was also obtained for this device.
